# Linked List Operations in C

Welcome to this repository! This program is a menu-driven C application that allows users to perform operations on different types of linked lists.

## Features

1. Types of Linked Lists Supported:
   - Singly Linked List
   - Doubly Linked List
   - Circular Linked List

2. Operations Supported:
   
   - Insertion:
     - Beginning of the list
     - End of the list
     - Specified position in the list

   - Deletion:
     - Beginning of the list
     - End of the list
     - Specified position in the list
     
   - Searching: Find a node with a specific value in the linked list.

## Prerequisites:
1. Make sure you have Visual Studio Code installed.
2. Install the C/C++ extension by Microsoft from the VS Code Marketplace.
3. Ensure you have a C compiler like GCC installed on your system.

## How to Run:

1. **Open VS Code**:
   - Launch Visual Studio Code.

2. **Open the Repository in VS Code**:
   - Click on `File` > `Open Folder` and select the directory of your cloned repository.

3. **Open the Integrated Terminal**:
   - In VS Code, you can open the integrated terminal by clicking on `View` > `Terminal` or using the shortcut `Ctrl + `` (backtick).

4. **Compile the Program**:
   - In the terminal, type the following command to compile your C program:
     ```bash
     gcc SuperLL.c -o output
     ```
     Replace `SuperLL.c` with the actual name of your C file. This will create an executable named `output`.

5. **Run the Program**:
   - In the terminal, type the following command to run your compiled program:
     ```bash
     ./output
     ```

6. **Follow the On-screen Prompts**:
   - Interact with your program as it runs in the integrated terminal.

By using the integrated terminal in VS Code, you get the advantage of writing, compiling, and running your code all within the same environment, which can be quite efficient for development.
